# AI Fraud Detection with Explainability

This project showcases a simple fraud detection system using a Random Forest Classifier along with SHAP for explainability.

## Features
- Transaction-based fraud prediction
- Model explainability with SHAP values
- Basic preprocessing and classification

## Technologies Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, shap

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the zip.
2. Open `Fraud_Detection_Model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to see fraud detection and SHAP explanations in action.

## Sample Dataset
A small dataset (`sample_transactions.csv`) is included for demonstration.
