🧠 Explainable AI Fraud Detection (Mini Project)
A lightweight fraud detection system built using Random Forest and SHAP explainability. Perfect for demonstrating real-world financial anomaly detection using Machine Learning.

🌟 Key Features
Detects fraudulent transactions using Random Forest

Model interpretability with SHAP values

Easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook interface

Clean, beginner-friendly Python code

Works on sample dataset (sample_transactions.csv)

🧪 Technologies Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook

pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, shap

📂 How to Run
Clone the repo or download as ZIP.

Open Fraud_Detection_Model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells sequentially to see fraud detection + SHAP explanations in action.

📊 Sample Output
Prediction result on transactions
